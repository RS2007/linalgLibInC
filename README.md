## Trying to build a linear algebra library from scratch ##

Just wanted to know how numpy and the other gazillion linalg libraries work,finally found neat matrix library(https://github.com/nomemory/neat-matrix-library) ,tried following it through , got lost at the echelon form implementation and LU decompositions , wrote my own versions of them 

** More features coming soon **
